Oh, hey! 

I'm Scott, and I'm on an exciting journey to combine my lifelong passion for video games with my skills in software development. I completed a software engineering boot camp over two years ago, where I gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and React. However, it was my love for gaming that drove me to explore game development further.

Ever since I can remember, I've been captivated by the enchanting worlds of video games. From the immersive storytelling to the intricate mechanics, games have always been a source of joy and inspiration for me. As I grew older, I knew I wanted to be more than just a player; I wanted to create the magic that had captivated me for so long.

While my career initially led me down a different path as a hairstylist, my passion for game development never wavered. I decided to take matters into my own hands and pursued various online courses, including those from gamedev.tv and Udemy. Through these courses, I've created several game development projects that have allowed me to explore different genres and technologies.
